# RotCLI

NOTE: this maybe be added with multiple types of decryption <br><br>
RotCLI allows users to do rotational ciphers where K = 0 -> 26 ; this allows for streamlined bruteforcing <br>
this also allows you to do specific rotations.
<br>

## Usage

```
python3 RotCLI.py -m "message" -N key # For direct N=key
python3 Rot.py -M "$(cat ../output)" -B # Bruteforcing All Keys
python3 Rot.py -M "$(cat test.txt)" -B -L # For Large Sample Size
```

This script uses argparse to parse the input, due to the fact this will mostly by used while in a bash or zsh shell I have decided to not add an input file section to achieve the same result you can use the above syntax. As a default this code will use N=13 if the value of N is not given alongside it's flag e.g. `-N K` <br>
<br>

## Flags

```
-M | Pass the Message to run through the rotational cipher
-N | Pass the N-rotational value [Default is 13]
-B | Switch for bruteforce the N-val
-L | Switch for Letter-Goodness
```

<br>

## Output

```
python3 Rot.py -M "$(cat ../file)" -N 14

        Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph
        is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
         coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as ‚Äúa group of sen
        tences or a single sentence that forms a unit‚Äù (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determ
        ine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journal
        istic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sen
        tences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the ‚Äúcontrolling idea,‚Äù because i
        t controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

## Caesar Algorithm Implementation

This code follows the standard caesar algorithm <br>

```
C[i] - i-th character of the ciphertext
P[i] - i-th character of the plaintext
k - Shift value
m - Length of the alphabet (26)
```

This means encryption is done using the following <br>

```
T[i] = (C[i + k % 26)]
```

hence decryption is done using <br>

```
P[i] = T[i - (k % 26)]
```

it is worth noting that due to how most decryption methods work, they use wrap around values only using the encryption algorithm, since that K=-12 is the same as K=14 hence to fit in with this commonplace the script only uses the first mentioned method. <br>
